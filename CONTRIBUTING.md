# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. All contributions will be considered, but we can't guarantee that everything will be implemented.

## Pull Requests

- **We only accept code contributions via pull request.** If you want to make a change, make a pull request. If you want to discuss a change, make an issue.
- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard.](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)**.
- **Test!** Please write tests for as much as possible. We don't aim for 100%, but we try to test all the important bits.
- **Document.** Make sure you update any documentation. The `README.md` and any other relevant documentation should be kept up-to-date. The Attach√© documentation repo is at [https://github.com/tpg/attache-docs]().
- **Consider our version numbers.** We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/) as much as possible but things are little hairy until 1.0.0 is released.
- **Create branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per change.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

For any major features or request, please open an issue of [GitHub](https://github.com/tpg/payfast/issues) first to discuss your ideas.
